# [Cozy](https://cozy.io) Proxy

Cozy Proxy redirects requests properly to the right application of the Cozy
platform depending on given path. It also handles authentication to the Cozy
for users and devices.

## Install

We assume here that the Cozy platform is correctly [installed](https://dev.cozy.io/#getting-started)
 on your server.

Type this command to install the proxy module:

```sh
$ cozy-monitor install proxy
```

## Contribution

You can contribute to the Cozy Proxy in many ways:

* Pick up an [issue](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy/issues?state=open) and solve it.
* Translate it in [a new language](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy/tree/master/client/app/locales).
* Improve the session management.

## Listen on https

It is recommended to run Cozy Proxy behind a reverse proxy like nginx. The
reverse proxy does the SSL/TLS stuff in that case. But if you want to run Cozy
Proxy with no reverse proxy (low memory server for example), you can set the
following env variables:

```sh
USE_SSL=true
SSL_CRT_PATH=/path/to/server.crt  # /etc/cozy/server.crt by default
SSL_KEY_PATH=/path/to/server.key  # /etc/cozy/server.key by default
```

To use this when the whole Cozy stack is running, you can add this variables
into the Controller configuration file, `/etc/cozy/controller.json`, as
[explained into the
documentation](https://docs.cozy.io/en/hack/cookbooks/controller.html#configuration).
Just add the following lines into this file:

```json
"env": {
  "proxy": {
    "PORT": 443,
    "USE_SSL": true,
    "SSL_CRT_PATH": "/path/to/server.crt",
    "SSL_KEY_PATH": "/path/to/server.key"
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

The Cozy proxy has a default timeout of 120 seconds. If an application doesn't anwser in 120 seconds, the Proxy will close the connection. If your server is slow, you may want to increase this timeout. Just edit `server.js` inside the build directory of your proxy (usually `/usr/local/cozy/apps/proxy/node_modules/cozy-proxy/build/server`) and add `server.timeout = 0` juste after `return americano.start(options, function(err, app, server) {`.

## Hack

To be hacked, the Cozy Proxy dev environment requires that a CouchDB instance
and a Cozy Data System instance are running. Then you can start the Cozy Proxy
this way:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy.git
$ cd cozy-proxy
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
```

### To hack cozy-proxy using the cozy vagrant

- Forward cozy-home application port from the virtual machine: `config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9103, host: 9103` in file Vagrantfile
  (if the virtual machine is already up, you can apply this change with `vagrant reload`)
- On your computer, go to your cozy-proxy folder `cd your-cozy-proxy-folder`
- Run `npm install`
- Once install is done, launch cozy-proxy `PORT=9555 HOST="0.0.0.0" npm run watch` (You may use another port)
- You can now access the hacked proxy on `http://localhost:9555` with your navigator

## Tests

![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cozy/cozy-proxy.png?branch=master)

To run tests, type the following command into the Cozy Proxy folder:

```sh
$ npm run test
```

Note: a running data-system is required for the tests.

## Contribute with Transifex

Transifex can be used the same way as git. It can push or pull translations. The config file in the .tx repository configure the way Transifex is working : it will get the json files from the locales repository.
If you want to learn more about how to use this tool, I'll invite you to check [this](http://docs.transifex.com/introduction/) tutorial.
