###
application

Main application that create a Mn.Application singleton and exposes it. Needs
router and app_layout view.
###

{Application} = require 'backbone.marionette'

Router    = require './routes'
AppLayout = require './views/app_layout'

Onboarding = require './lib/onboarding'
StepModel = require './models/step'
ProgressionModel = require './models/progression'

class App extends Application

    ###
    Sets application

    We instanciate root application components
    - router: we pass the app reference to it to easily get it without requiring
              application module later.
    - layout: the application layout view, rendered.
