# [Cozy](http://cozy.io) Proxy

Cozy Proxy redirects requests properly to the right application of the Cozy
platform depending on given path. It also handles authentication to the Cozy
for users and devices.

## Install

We assume here that the Cozy platform is correctly [installed](https://raw.github.com/cozy/cozy-setup/gh-pages/assets/images/happycloud.png)
 on your server.

Type this command to install the proxy module:

    cozy-monitor install proxy

## Contribution

You can contribute to the Cozy Proxy in many ways:

* Pick up an [issue](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy/issues?state=open) and solve it.
* Translate it in [a new language](https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy/tree/master/client/app/locales).
* Improve the session management.

## Hack

To be hacked, the Cozy Proxy dev environment requires that a CouchDB instance
and a Cozy Data System instance are running. Then you can start the Cozy Proxy
this way:

    git clone https://github.com/cozy/cozy-proxy.git
    cd cozy-proxy
    npm install -g brunch coffee-script coffeelint
    npm install
    cd client
    npm install
    cd ..
    coffee server.coffee

Each modification requires a new build, here is how to run a build:

    cake build

### To hack cozy-proxy using the cozy vagrant

- Forward a new port from the virtual machine (for example: `config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 9555, host: 9555` in file Vagrantfile)
- Go in the shared folder `cd /vagrant` and `cd your-cozy-proxy-folder`
- `rm -rf node_modules/bcrypt && npm install`
- Launch cozy-proxy `PORT=9555 HOST="0.0.0.0" coffee server.coffee`
- You can now access the hacked proxy on `http://localhost:9555` with your navigator
